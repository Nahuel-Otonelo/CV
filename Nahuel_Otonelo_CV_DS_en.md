<p class="extra-space"><em>My experience and knowledge in the field of data were mostly acquired during my more than 4-year professional career in industrial plants, alongside my duties as a project engineer. With a proactive and self-taught approach, I have carried out multiple projects modeling and analyzing data from large-scale industrial production processes. I developed relevant indicators on efficiencies, consumption, and performance of industrial equipment. The results of these projects led to significant reductions in operating and maintenance costs and obtaining certifications such as the ISO 50001 standard in energy efficiency. I stand out for my commitment and responsibility in each task, approaching them with passion and dedication, aiming to present innovative solutions that add value.</em></p>
